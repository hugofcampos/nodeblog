# NodeBlog

A very simple Node.js blog by a Node.js beginner 

## Run instructions
  
    $ cd /path/to/project

    $ npm install

Clone /core/config.default.js to /core/config.js and set your configurations up
  
    $ npm start

Then access http://localhost:3000 in your browser

To access admin: http://localhost:3000/admin

## Test instructions

  $ cd /path/to/project

  $ npm test

## Admin considerations

After installing, the blog has no user registered, so everyone can access /admin pages.

As soon as you register the first user, login will be required.
